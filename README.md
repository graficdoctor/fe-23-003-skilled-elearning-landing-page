## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

As for the naming of my selectors in CSS, I took inspiration from [Cube CSS](https://cube.fyi/). It's the first time I was writing following these rules as it is closer to how I generally write my CSS.

I'm struggling implementing the `<picture>`-element.

### Continued development

How to properly use the `<picture>`element.

### Useful resources

- [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/) - CUBE CSS is a CSS methodology that’s orientated towards simplicity, pragmatism and consistency. It’s designed to work with the medium that you’re working in.
